# hello-world

Hi world! 

My name's Lucy and I'm starting my coding journey - exploring how it can help my in my role at a Public Services business! 
So far I've got basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and have experience writing SQL queries (primarily working with MSSQL) as well as Google Apps Scripts.
